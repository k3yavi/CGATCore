CGATCore documentation!
=======================

CGAT-core is a workflow management system that allows users to quickly and reproducibly build scalable
data analysis pipelines. CGAT-core is  a set of libraries and helper functions used to enable researchers
to design and build computational workflows for the analysis of large-scale data-analysis. 

Used in combination with CGAT-apps, we have deomonstrated the functionality of functionality of our
flexible implementation using a set of well documented, easy to install and easy to use workflows, 
called CGAT-flow.

CGAT-core is open-sourced, powerful and user-friendly, and has been continually developed 
as a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflow management system over the past 10 years.
